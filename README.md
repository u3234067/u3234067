- 👋 Hi, I’m a Software engineer / Data engineer... hmmm, that sounds fancy, hey? 
- 👀 I’m interested in Software engineering, Data Science... but most of the time, I'm interested in making my simple code work, or understanding why other people's code work.
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a mule.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: any IT related thingy, or maybe not, a tennis game is better, right?
- 📫 How to reach me ... star jumps.
